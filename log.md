# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Lilin

### Day 0: June 16, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the webinar on *Python for Science and Data: Images*

**Thoughts:** I'm still completing a final project for my Python starter course, but I get sidetracked and decide to also do leetcode problems on the side, and after wondering on Leetcode for an hour or so, I change my idea. 

Specifically, I encountered problems when doing *Middle of The Linked List* and *Ransom Note* because I don't know about the concept of linked list and hash map (haven't encountered those concepts in my previous study. So I decided to just leave them there for the moment and maybe pick them up in the future.)
After that, I wonder around the Array 101 (which uses Java as an example) and also the front page problems that are marked as easy (as directed by the Leetcode starter guide) and then stop, feeling confused. After more searching, I decided I should not start Leetcode until I get more comfortable programming. 

TODO: For the Python webinar, I haven't put what the teacher have taught into practice yet. I will put it into practice at a later date, so this is another thing in my TODO list besides the more imperative final project. 

### Day 1: June 17, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final project for my Python starter course, got the certificate. 

**Thoughts:** I feel immersed when doing the project, but I need to improve on that more when I can. I also want to create the blinking effect but don't know how yet. Creating the project is also like linking all those that I previously have learnt together. 
I spent a lot of time finding the matching color, and care much about how the project look like. I think maybe I can learn more about design? But I'm not sure about that. Maybe get all the programming basics first. 

### Day 2: June 18, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Completed two courses, one on Git and one on Python, one hour each. The follow-up step is to do some practice or create new projects to consolidate the concepts learned. 

**Thoughts:** It's hard to stick to something especially when unexpected things in life is happening. But I need to stay on the habit and keep coding, or if not, keep learning coding. 
I hope that I can soon find job opportunity to leave my current environment. Hopefully I can rebuild some projects or earn more certificates to prove my front end skills, which is acquire a year ago. But up until now all the jobs I've seen require a relevant degree or 1 year plus relevant experience. 

### Day 3: June 19, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Read about how the Internet work and how the web web work.

### Day 4: June 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded GitHub repo to my end and edited it in VSCode. After that, push the edited file to GitHub. I also learned how to clone my private repo.

Asides from that, I did a little bit of web development related reading. 

**Thoughts**: I haven't done a lot this day and procrastinated a lot, as I've already miss two days streak and are under the pressure of meeting one of the requirements of the 100 days of code, which is spending at least one hour per day in coding. May be I should adjust my strategy to code or learn about a code for a least 10 minutes everyday, as the original plan may be more difficult to stick to, with unexpected things happen in life. By doing at least a bit every day, it's easier to have consistency.

### Day 5: June 22, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Today I've been focusing on learning *Command Line Basics*. 

**Thoughts**: It's not difficult but takes a lot of patience to follow the content and practice it step by step. In some ways, it's boring, learning the vocabulary of using the terminals, but it's a must if I want to go about learning programming. 

It's hard for me to follow the long artcle though... It can get boring real quick... 

### Day 6: June 25, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Today I've been focusing on learning *Command Line Basics*, focusing on the final part of it. 

**Thoughts**: Haven't finished reading it due to limited energy. But I manage to give it a good start today after several days of not being productive. I think I can get better at both English and programming day by day as long as I'm consistent in improving both of them. 


### Day 7: June 26, 2024 

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**: Today I have a better state to focus on the task at hand. I have been intensively studing the final part of *Command Line Basics*, picking up those that I've not been able to pick up yesterday. I feel great because I can finally get through this part; with a little bit more effort tomorrow to complete what's left with this whole section, I can get into the next phase of study. 

The *Command Line Basics* have always been a daunting task for me. I've tried various sources previously with no avail. Finally at this phase of my life I make some progress with it. At least I've followed through the majority of the material and is able to expriment with those commands, its variation and different usages. 


### Day 8: June 28, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: (1) Review Git basics and read through all the recommended materials; (2) Going through the Git setup process again by following the standard procecss on my terminal, just in case I may have miss some steps or set up inproperly when I last set up Git on my PC; (3) Create repositories and edit them following the recommended process. 

**Thoughts**: Now I know I can type **`code .`** in the terminal to open the current working directory in VSCode, instead of going to the VSCode and then open the folder I need to work on through GUI. This just saves a lot of time and is more fun to work with. 

But learning the common commands for terminal and setting up Git is still one of the most daunting things I can think of when learning programming, because it requires a lot of patience. Although I have learned about some of these before, I still stick to the tutorials just in case I get something missed in my previous studies. 

It turns out I have learnt a lot through this process. I have not only pick up the concepts I had forgotten but also learned new ones that I hadn't been exposed to before. Hard work paid off, although it is not easy to get through all of this all at once. 

Anyway, I have gotten through this and can finally jump into the actual programming languages in my next step.  

### Day 9: July 1, 2024 

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**: 
For the past three days (as the progress is slow, I would just count it as one day) I did some reading of *Introduction to HTML*, specifically, about what is HTML, can it be counted as a programming language, elements and tags, HTML boilerplate, shortcut of opening the HTML in browser with the `open` command, how to work with HTML text elements, how elements like `<strong>` and `<em>` are different from `<b>` and `<i>` with semantic emphasis that can aid screen readers and promote accessibility, nesting and indentation, HTML comments and its shortcuts, and the two different kinds of lists. I've also skimmed through the *Links and Images*. I would practice this tomorrow, as during the day I got interrupted by the construction noise in the same building and have to go outside while most of the libraries are closed on Monday, and I also need to attend a virtual lecture on other humanities topics later. 

Strictly speaking, HTML and CSS are not counted as programming language, as they are not used to program any logic, their main function is presenting information. HTML helps us create the structure of a webpage, of how you would like present your information, structurally, in the webpage, and CSS helps to decorate it. Actually I've learned them both before, one year ago. But I think it's necessary to go through them again. Hopefully I can refine or recreate the projects I've created after reviewing the fundamentals.

### Day 10: July 2, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Follow through the *Links and Images* reading and practice. Realize the importance of adding the `rel` attribute. The `noopener` and `nonreferer` value can help prevent phishing attacks. Although [newer versions of browsers automatically provide that kind of protection if `target = "_blank"` is used](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#security_and_privacy), it's considered good coding practice to add a `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to err on the side of caution.

**Thoughts**: I should add log right after completing the tasks at hand. 

### Day 11: July 3, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: 1. Complete reading *Commit Messages* and complete the *Recipe project*, a good wrap-up of the HTML basics; it's a sketch for further build up after reviewing other web basics.

**Thoughts**: I guess I need more practice as well as coding experience to implement the good coding practice as mentioned in *Commit message*. For now my git commit message may not need to be that long (as most of my commits are pretty basic for now, I don't need a body paragraph to explain how and why just yet, a subject line would be sufficient for now). 

I can start by sticking to the rules of capitalizing my subject line and using the imperative mood. (I need further reading in [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to refine my message)

EDIT: I planned to continue with CSS today but then I recieved an offer from the postgraduate school I applied for and need to prepare for Visa application. I think I should just go on with this school as the other school have stated that their review process could take another month. I think I wouldn't wait for that anymore. The pressure caused by uncertainty is just too much. I guess I need some sleep now. Glad that I wrote the log right after I completed the tasks or else I can't recall vividly with my current state.
