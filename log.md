# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Lilin

### Day 0: June 16, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the webinar on *Python for Science and Data: Images*

**Thoughts:** I'm still completing a final project for my Python starter course, but I get sidetracked and decide to also do leetcode problems on the side, and after wondering on Leetcode for an hour or so, I change my idea. 

Specifically, I encountered problems when doing *Middle of The Linked List* and *Ransom Note* because I don't know about the concept of linked list and hash map (haven't encountered those concepts in my previous study. So I decided to just leave them there for the moment and maybe pick them up in the future.)
After that, I wonder around the Array 101 (which uses Java as an example) and also the front page problems that are marked as easy (as directed by the Leetcode starter guide) and then stop, feeling confused. After more searching, I decided I should not start Leetcode until I get more comfortable programming. 

TODO: For the Python webinar, I haven't put what the teacher have taught into practice yet. I will put it into practice at a later date, so this is another thing in my TODO list besides the more imperative final project. 

### Day 1: June 17, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final project for my Python starter course, got the certificate. 

**Thoughts:** I feel immersed when doing the project, but I need to improve on that more when I can. I also want to create the blinking effect but don't know how yet. Creating the project is also like linking all those that I previously have learnt together. 
I spent a lot of time finding the matching color, and care much about how the project look like. I think maybe I can learn more about design? But I'm not sure about that. Maybe get all the programming basics first. 

### Day 2: June 18, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Completed two courses, one on Git and one on Python, one hour each. The follow-up step is to do some practice or create new projects to consolidate the concepts learned. 

**Thoughts:** It's hard to stick to something especially when unexpected things in life is happening. But I need to stay on the habit and keep coding, or if not, keep learning coding. 
I hope that I can soon find job opportunity to leave my current environment. Hopefully I can rebuild some projects or earn more certificates to prove my front end skills, which is acquire a year ago. But up until now all the jobs I've seen require a relevant degree or 1 year plus relevant experience. 

### Day 3: June 19, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Read about how the Internet work and how the web web work.

### Day 4: June 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded GitHub repo to my end and edited it in VSCode. After that, push the edited file to GitHub. I also learned how to clone my private repo.

Asides from that, I did a little bit of web development related reading. 

**Thoughts**: I haven't done a lot this day and procrastinated a lot, as I've already miss two days streak and are under the pressure of meeting one of the requirements of the 100 days of code, which is spending at least one hour per day in coding. May be I should adjust my strategy to code or learn about a code for a least 10 minutes everyday, as the original plan may be more difficult to stick to, with unexpected things happen in life. By doing at least a bit every day, it's easier to have consistency.
