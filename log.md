# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Lilin

### Day 0: June 16, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the webinar on *Python for Science and Data: Images*

**Thoughts:** I'm still completing a final project for my Python starter course, but I get sidetracked and decide to also do leetcode problems on the side, and after wondering on Leetcode for an hour or so, I change my idea. 

Specifically, I encountered problems when doing *Middle of The Linked List* and *Ransom Note* because I don't know about the concept of linked list and hash map (haven't encountered those concepts in my previous study. So I decided to just leave them there for the moment and maybe pick them up in the future.)
After that, I wonder around the Array 101 (which uses Java as an example) and also the front page problems that are marked as easy (as directed by the Leetcode starter guide) and then stop, feeling confused. After more searching, I decided I should not start Leetcode until I get more comfortable programming. 

TODO: For the Python webinar, I haven't put what the teacher have taught into practice yet. I will put it into practice at a later date, so this is another thing in my TODO list besides the more imperative final project. 

### Day 1: June 17, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final project for my Python starter course, got the certificate. 

**Thoughts:** I feel immersed when doing the project, but I need to improve on that more when I can. I also want to create the blinking effect but don't know how yet. Creating the project is also like linking all those that I previously have learnt together. 
I spent a lot of time finding the matching color, and care much about how the project look like. I think maybe I can learn more about design? But I'm not sure about that. Maybe get all the programming basics first.
